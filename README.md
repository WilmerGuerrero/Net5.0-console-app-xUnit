to solve the algorithm test i worked with loops and assert count, each codePeg within the guess list try to match with the codemaker code,
if it find similarities in color, then position and finally the result set list add one item (black or white) and the assert count increments 
(only with black resultPeg). Otherwise 
results set will not add one.

The test just try to complete de job with the data provided, working successfully
